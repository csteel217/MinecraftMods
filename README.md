## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

**Minecraft:** Ensure you have the correct version of Minecraft installed.

**Minecraft Forge:** The mod loader for Minecraft. Download it here.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/minecraft-mod-loader.git
Install Forge`

Download and install the appropriate version of Forge for your version of Minecraft from the Forge website.

### Set Up the Mods Folder

Create a mods folder in your Minecraft directory if it doesn't already exist. This is where you will place all your mod files.

**Windows:** `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods`

**Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods`

**Linux:** `~/.minecraft/mods`

## Usage

### Launch Minecraft with Forge

Open the Minecraft Launcher and select the Forge profile. Start the game to initialize the mods folder and verify the installation.

### Add Mods

Download your desired mods and place the .jar files into the mods folder you created earlier.

### Play

Start Minecraft with the Forge profile selected. Your mods should now be loaded and ready to use!

## Adding Mods

To add a mod to your Minecraft installation, follow these steps:

Download the mod file (a .jar file) from a trusted source.
Place the downloaded .jar file into the mods folder in your Minecraft directory.
Restart Minecraft to load the new mod.

## Troubleshooting

**Minecraft Crashes on Startup:** Ensure that all mods are compatible with the version of Forge you have installed. Check the mod documentation for version compatibility.
**Mod Not Working:** Verify that the mod file is placed correctly in the mods folder. Ensure that the mod is compatible with your Minecraft and Forge versions.
**Other Issues:** Check the Minecraft and Forge logs located in the logs folder in your Minecraft directory for detailed error messages.
